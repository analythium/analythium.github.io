You mastered Shiny and Dash, you followed best practices and your data application is production-ready. Now you only have to deploy and host your app. Information about hosting data apps is scattered around the Internet and often incomplete. The goal of the [Hosting Data Apps](https://hosting.analythium.io?utm_source=as-hub&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=launch-april-2021) website is to help you learn about your hosting options and to pick the option that suits your needs best.
