## Who we are

[Analythium](https://www.analythium.io/) is a startup made up of senior data scientists,
mathematicians and statisticians, and domain experts.
We joined forces to optimize the environmental and energy industries
by democratizing data science via tailored app development.

Our [team members](https://www.analythium.io/about/) have built their careers in industry,
applying machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robust mathematical and statistical
methods to real-world problems to improve business functionality and enable
pinpointed data accuracy.

## What we do

We call upon domain expertise from our network of globally-renowned academic
researchers to better scope data problems in complex organizations.
We leverage that expertise along with business acumen to identify business needs,
and act as a translator to speak the language of data scientists and determine which
problems are best solved using data science methods and algorithms.

## How we do it

We do it like BOM: **B**uild, **O**perate, and **M**anage:

1. once we identified a need, we start building a prototype. We keep iterating on the prototype until we can [build](build) a product that we can start showcasing to clients,
2. then we deploy as part of our [operations](operate) using proven technologies,
3. the final product is then ready to be showcased and used [improve management decisions](manage).
