Containers provide portability, consistency, and are used for packaging, deploying, and running cloud-native data science applications.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the most popular virtualization environment to
deliver software in containers. Containers bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files and are isolated from one another.
Containers are the run-time environments or instances defined by container images.

Docker is well supported by the R community, the [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/)
project provides different base images for R.

In this section we will review how to containerize a Shiny application,
first reviewing the basics of [working with Docker](containers-docker), than we'll see how to create a [Docker image with a Shiny app](containers-shiny).
